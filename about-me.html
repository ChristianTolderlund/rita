      <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
      <p class="text-about">
        My name is Rita Howis. I am a creative rebel and an artist by heart.
        Originally from Russia, I have lived in 7 countries and now happily
        settled in Denmark - the hotspot for design and sustainability.<br /><br />

        Art is a universal language, capable of spanning across borders and age
        groups. My mission is to create exclusive pieces of artwork that
        everybody can relate to regardless of their background and culture.<br /><br />

        Being adventurous and inventive, I have developed a signature technique
        called Colorflow that mimics the wonders of nature. My art is exclusive
        and unique â€“ paintings are plated with 24K gold and silver.<br /><br />

        My art is showcased and sold across the world - from Japan to the U.S.

      <h1>ABOUT COLORFLOW</h1>
      <br />
      <h5>What is colorflow?</h5>
      <p class="text-about">
        My mission is to make exclusive pieces of artwork that everybody can
        relate to. Inspired by nature, I've developed a unique technique using
        fluid paint materials that mimic our natural environment.<br /><br />

        Developing this technique, I came up with the COLORFLOW concept,
        portraying the wonderful landscapes across different parts of our planet
        to raise awareness about the environmental issues that we face.<br /><br />

        I am working with different mediums, natural colors, and sustainably
        sourced 24K gold.<br /><br />

        I use COLORFLOW as a space where I can express the story and intentions
        behind my art. Currently based in Copenhagen, my inspiration draws upon
        a vision to also reflect the Danish design philosophy of minimalism and
        simplicity.<br /><br />

        I also conduct workshops on this style with a mission to bring people
        closer to art in a creative and playful manner. It is a unique
        experience with a tangible end result that fits well into a Scandinavian
        design context.<br /><br />

        Contact me if you are interested in a workshop.

        <h5>PLANT A TREE FOR EACH ARTWORK</h5>
        <p id="smaller-text" class="text-about">
          I choose to team up with EcoTree and from now on I plant a tree from
          each produced or sold painting!<br /><br />

          Once you have purchased the artwork from me, you will receive the
          certificate with the details of the newly planted tree on your
          behalf!<br /><br />

          You can see the tree details when buying an artwork or you can choose
          the tree yourself when ordering a commission art.<br /><br />
